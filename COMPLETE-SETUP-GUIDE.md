# 🚀 Complete Deployment Setup Guide

## 📋 Current Status
- ✅ **Backend**: Render.com (https://gandhii-bai-crm.onrender.com)
- ✅ **Database**: Hostinger MySQL (srv1639.hstgr.io)
- 🔄 **Frontend**: Ready for GitHub → Domain deployment

## 🎯 Next Steps to Complete Setup

### 1. 🔐 Configure GitHub Secrets (Required for Auto-Deploy)

Go to your GitHub repository → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions

Add these secrets:

```
FTP_SERVER = your-hosting-ftp-server.com
FTP_USERNAME = your-ftp-username
FTP_PASSWORD = your-ftp-password
```

**For Hostinger, typically:**
- FTP_SERVER: `files.000webhost.com` or your specific server
- FTP_USERNAME: Your hosting username
- FTP_PASSWORD: Your hosting password

### 2. 📁 Hostinger File Manager Setup

1. Login to your Hostinger control panel
2. Go to File Manager
3. Navigate to your domain folder (usually `public_html/`)
4. Ensure it's empty or backup existing files

### 3. 🔄 Enable Auto-Deployment

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
- Push to GitHub main branch
- GitHub Actions will auto-build and deploy
- Check the "Actions" tab in GitHub for deployment status

**Option B: Manual Deployment**
```bash
# Build for production
npm run deploy:build

# Upload dist/ folder contents to your hosting
# via FTP, File Manager, or hosting control panel
```

### 4. 🌐 Domain Configuration (If Needed)

Ensure your domain points to your hosting:
- **A Record**: Points to your hosting server IP
- **DNS**: Properly configured for your hosting

### 5. ✅ Test Deployment

After deployment, test:
1. **Frontend**: https://crm.gandhibaideaddictioncenter.com
2. **API Connection**: Check if frontend connects to Render backend
3. **Database**: Verify data loads correctly

## 🔧 Configuration Files Created

### ✅ Files Added/Updated:
- `.env` - Now configured for production
- `.env.production` - Production environment variables
- `.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml` - Auto-deployment workflow
- `package.json` - Added deployment scripts

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Environment Switching
- **Development**: Comment out production URLs in `.env`
- **Production**: Keep production URLs active in `.env`

### Build Process
The system will automatically:
1. Install dependencies
2. Set production environment variables
3. Build optimized frontend
4. Deploy to your domain via FTP

### First Deployment
After setting up GitHub secrets, simply:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Deploy to production"
git push origin main
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **FTP Connection Failed**: Check FTP credentials in GitHub secrets
2. **Build Errors**: Check GitHub Actions logs
3. **API Not Connecting**: Verify Render backend is running
4. **Domain Not Loading**: Check DNS and hosting configuration

### Support:
- GitHub Actions logs for deployment issues
- Render.com logs for backend issues
- Hostinger support for hosting/domain issues
