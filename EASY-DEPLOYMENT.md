## ✅ **What's Fixed:**

1. **❌ Removed** - Unnecessary `.env.production` file (using single `.env` file)
2. **❌ Removed** - FTP server requirements (simplified deployment)  
3. **❌ Removed** - All test files from `public/` folder (clean production build)
4. **✅ Added** - All files uploaded to GitHub repository

## 🎯 **Easy Deployment Process:**

### **Method 1: Automatic Build (Recommended)**
1. **Push code to GitHub** (Already done! ✅)
2. **GitHub Actions builds automatically** 
3. **Download build files from GitHub Actions**
4. **Upload to your hosting**

### **Method 2: Manual Build**
