# 🚀 Frontend Deployment Fix Guide

## 📋 Problem Diagnosis
- ✅ Backend API is working perfectly on Render.com
- ✅ CORS is properly configured for your subdomain
- ❌ Frontend on subdomain has outdated build with wrong API URLs
- ❌ Login attempts go to localhost:4000 instead of production API

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Upload Fresh Build to Subdomain

1. **Compress the dist folder:**
   - Navigate to `d:\Final CRM\5\dist`
   - Select all files and folders inside `dist`
   - Create a ZIP file named `crm-frontend-latest.zip`

2. **Upload to your hosting (Hostinger):**
   - Login to Hostinger cPanel/File Manager
   - Navigate to your subdomain folder (usually `crm/public_html` or similar)
   - Delete all existing files
   - Upload and extract `crm-frontend-latest.zip`

### Step 2: Verify Environment Configuration

The frontend is now built with these production settings:
```
VITE_API_URL=https://gandhi-bai.onrender.com/api
VITE_BASE_URL=https://crm.gandhibaideaddictioncenter.com
```

### Step 3: Test After Upload

1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+F5)
2. Visit `https://crm.gandhibaideaddictioncenter.com`
3. Open browser console - should see no localhost errors
4. Try logging in with: `admin@aedentek.com` / `Aedentek@123#`

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ No "Connection Error" messages
- ✅ No localhost:4000 API calls in console
- ✅ All API calls go to gandhi-bai.onrender.com
- ✅ Login works successfully
- ✅ Photos and assets load properly

## 📊 Current API Status (All Working)

- Health: ✅ https://gandhi-bai.onrender.com/api/health
- Settings: ✅ https://gandhi-bai.onrender.com/api/settings  
- Users: ✅ https://gandhi-bai.onrender.com/api/management-users
- Login: ✅ Ready for authentication

## 🚨 Quick Alternative (If Upload Issues)

If you can't upload immediately, you can test locally:
```cmd
cd "d:\Final CRM\5"
npm run preview
```

This will serve the production build locally to verify it works.
